Active learning of network topology in a latent space

Start from an empty graph.
Every step you can pick a pair of node to test if a link exists between the pair.
Find all links efficiently.

Need a unified model for network topologies: latent space model.
Need a clever way to learn the model using incomplete data and using the model to do link predicts.
